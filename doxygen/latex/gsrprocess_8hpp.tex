GSR model process with piecewise volatilities and mean reversions, the dynamic is expressed in some T-\/forward measure. If a single value for the mean reversion is provided, it is assumed constant. Results are cached for performance reasons, so if parameters change you need to call flush\+Cache() to avoid inconsistent results. For a derivation of the formulas, see \href{http://ssrn.com/abstract=2246013}{\texttt{ http\+://ssrn.\+com/abstract=2246013}}.
